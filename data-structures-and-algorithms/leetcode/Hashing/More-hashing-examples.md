## More hashing examples

Hash maps are nearly ubiquitous. We've talked about some of the most common patterns, but there are an unlimited number of ways you can incorporate hash maps into an algorithm. Because of how important hash maps are, we'll look at a couple more examples of how hash maps can be used in various problems. It is crucial that you are comfortable with hash maps if you want to pass interviews.

**Example 1:**

[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the [anagrams]() together.

For example, given `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`, return `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`.
